    <p>My name is Milad Karimi and I'm currently studying Computer Science at University of North Florida.</p>
    <p>
        I became a dual citizen in 2013. I was born in Esfahan Iran but moved to the US in 2008.
        I was a competitive wrestler back in high school, but I quit after not getting into the regional team.

    <h2 id="hobbies-header">Hobbies</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is watching documentaries or listening to podcasts. Not only is it fun and entertaining,
        it also gives my mind new information to absorb and think about.<br /> I really enjoy the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage" target="_blank">Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</a> tv series by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" target="_blank"> Carl Sagan.</a>  </p>
    <p>
        Recently, Do It Yourself projects have become my hobby and I’ve had a lot of fun doing it. During the quarantine I started on a few projects around the house and ever since then I’ve had this urge of wanting to do stuff.
        Whether it's something as simple as changing a door knob or building a fire pit in the backyard, fixing or building something yourself is always a satisfying feeling.
